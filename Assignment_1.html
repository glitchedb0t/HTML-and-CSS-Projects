			<blockquote cite = "https://petersengames.com/call-of-cthulhu-interview-with-the-creator-sandy-petersen/">
			 Here’s the deal. If you want a game in which you have the same old steroid-pumped champions confronting the baddies, every other RPG can provide this. But if you want a game in which the emphasis is far more cerebral, and more dangerous, and in which the enemies pose an existential threat – there is only Call of Cthulhu. - Sandy Petersen
