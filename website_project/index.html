						<h1>The Vaults</h1>
						<p>Here at Vault-Tech Industries our goal is to preserve the American way of life in the face of nuclear apocolypse. These are uncertain times. War plasters the front of every newspaper, looming and violent. In response Vault-Tech has invested billions of dollars into the development of high functionality shelters that will keep hardworking American citizens safe in the event of a nuclear bomb.</p><br>
						<img src ="./images/Vault_Map.png" width = "960" height = "540" alt = "Map of the US with yellow pin indicators showing the location of vaults">
						<br><p>To date we have built over ten vaults on both the East and West coasts in areas that are the most likely to be hit in the event of a nuclear attack. Although spaces are limited we are accepting reservations for families or singles looking to protect themselves and continue their lives unburdened by the harsh reality of war. Peruse our gallery of images showcasing Vault life, watch the video that highlights our ideology, and then fill out the contact form to get in contact with a Vault-Tech representative today!</p>
